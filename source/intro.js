Licensed under the "You should follow @HenrikJoreteg on Twitter to use this" license. (Because, apparently I'm a twitter whore like that)

This is a simple template storage and retrieval system.

Templates are stored in the document as script elements with type="text/html". Cheers to @jeresig for this idea.

They are processed through Moustache.js for templating.

Dependencies:
- jQuery
